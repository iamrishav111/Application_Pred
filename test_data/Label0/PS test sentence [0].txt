“Caring  for  a  patient  is  not  curing  a  patient  of  disease.”  While  a  simple  concept  we  are  taught
repeatedly, it is one that goes against the grain of first instinct or public notions of a physician’s role. I
came to understand this clearly and concretely through a kind and elderly woman while on my internal
medicine rotation. Initially presenting with shortness of breath and lower extremity edema, my patient
was  later  found  to  have  advanced  breast  cancer  with  metastasis  to  her  pelvic  organs  causing  ureteral
obstruction.  Following  bilateral  nephrostomy  tube  placements  by  Interventional  Radiology  (IR),  I
continued to examine my patient daily and saw first-hand her immediate and remarkable symptomatic
relief. Over the course of the week, I had gotten to know the patient better and learned of her wishes for
palliative care. I learned that my patient wanted a comfortable passing in her cabin with a view of the
Appalachian  Mountains  reminiscent  of  her  childhood  home.  On  her  discharge,  I  felt  honored  for  her
gratefulness  towards  me  and  was  deeply  aware  of  IR’s  impactful  intervention  in  her  end-of-life  goals.
While this marked one of my first encounters with IR as a third year student, my interest in IR began as a
first  year  student  and  developed  with  involvement  spanning  local  and  national  leadership,  academic
research, global health, and medical device invention.

      I first learned of IR prior to medical school while working in a research lab developing oncologic
therapies. After founding the IR Interest Group during my first year under the guidance of my mentors,
Dr.  Gary  Siskin  and  Dr.  Allen  Herr,  I  organized  introductory  IR  lectures,  panels,  and  eventually
spearheaded the 3rd Annual Northeast Regional IR Symposium, which was the first of its kind held at
Albany Medical College with over 100 attendees. It was exciting to see passionate attendings teach eager
students about IR through both lectures and hands-on simulations. Their passion for medical education
was as clear as their passion for patient care, research, and innovation: passions I hope to exemplify as a
physician.

      Throughout my medical school career, I have tried to embody the innovative spirit of IR through
medical device invention, inspired from my patient experiences. As a first year, I saw the invasive nature
of temporal artery biopsy for diagnosing giant cell arteritis, and then iterated designs for an endoluminal
resectioning  device.  I  quickly  encountered  technical  design  challenges,  but  learned  to  pivot  towards
alternative  applications.  In  my  second  year,  I  developed  interlocking  endovascular  discs  for  fistula
formation for dialysis. This design was inspired by the time I spent with my father, who at the time was
reconciling the different options for dialysis. Through each experience, I learned to be adaptable in the
inventions, while recognizing the patient as the top priority. My most recent endeavor in nephrostomy
re-design, was inspired through caring for the obstructed cancer patient described above. Its success has
led to provisional patenting, start-up incorporation, and investor funding. While I have found biodesign to
be extremely exciting, it has come with more failures than successes. I have learned to see those instances
as  opportunities  for  growth  and  development.  In  many  ways,  IR  combines  everything  I  find  exciting
about medicine: patient-centered care, medical imaging, creativity, and a growing frontier of innovations.

      As an aspiring radiologist and interventionalist, I hope to find and deliver the news of normal for my
patients, but also provide the best procedural-based care when necessary.  Throughout my clerkships, I
have found that I enjoy patient contact and look forward to establishing a strong rapport with my own
patients.  I  realize  that  a  successful  career  in  radiology  requires  more  than  a  desire  to  help  others,  and
comes with intensive training and frustrating realities at times. Nevertheless, my journey has shown me
that there are greatly rewarding moments that will definitely make it all the more worthwhile.
