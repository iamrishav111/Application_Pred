 

I first became interested in imaging in the blistering 124°F summer heat of Rancho Mirage, California.
Receiving a scholarship to participate in the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation Summer Institute for
Medical Students was equal parts humbling and daunting, having grown up with a family member whose
addiction was all too present and not at all spoken. Now in this immersive program, along with a handful
of other medical students, I would be fully incorporated into all aspects of addiction treatment. It was
through this program I was introduced to functional connectivity studies and neuroimaging in addiction.

Quickly, I began to pursue my interest in addiction and neuroimaging, co-founding the Wake Forest
Addiction Medicine Interest Group and receiving scholarship funds to attend the Governor’s Institute on
Substance Abuse Conference, where information about our new interest group was presented to regional
addiction medicine experts. Meanwhile, my childhood neighbor and closest thing I, an only child, had to
a brother was in and out of treatment for his newly developed substance use disorder. This disease struck
again, this time almost taking a young life. 

A year after my time at the Betty Ford Center, I began my clinical rotations and went into the reading
room for the first time. Upon entry into its dark walls, the computers lit up like little diagnostic beacons
of hope, holding the answers to patient’s pathology. I was transported to a time four years prior when my
life changed instantly through a radiologist’s read on my mother’s mammogram. Within days, I went
from a Division I athlete to my mother’s primary care giver as she would go on to battle and beat
aggressive breast cancer. It was through that experience that I became acutely attuned to the importance
and power of an accurate diagnosis. Worse than the news of triple negative breast cancer was the waiting
period. With the diagnosis came a welcomed outset for her treatment and ultimate remission. The
diagnosis was a gift. 

With these experiences, I chose Diagnostic Radiology as a specialty and gained a deeper interest in
neuroimaging research outside of addiction medicine. I sought the opportunity to spend a year performing
research under Dr. James Stone, learning from leaders in the fields of cortical thickness mapping and
machine learning. The goal of this research year was to develop machine learning tools for the automated
identification of lesions consistent with traumatic brain injury using human trained manual
segmentations. In doing so, I created a machine learning database of thousands of images, utilized new
volume-based cortical thickness processors, and produced quality research in the field of radiology and
neuroimaging. Returning to Wake Forest for my final year of medical school, I established the Wake
Forest Radiology Scholars Certificate Program to help promote the field and increase image
interpretation competency in preclinical medical students.

To help deliver patients from a state of the unknown through the careful art of diagnosis is a privilege.
The intricate balance of delivering information that may be a patient’s worst fear while also providing a
starting point for the creation of a solution is a delicate and poignant one. These are the complexities I
saw executed as a concerned family member during my time as a caregiver and again in the reading room
as a medical student. I would be honored to provide care in this manner and am motivated to become a
clinician in this rapidly changing and dynamic field.
